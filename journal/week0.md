# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
## Getting the AWS CLI working
 Installed the AWS CLI using gitpod environment and saved the configuration file in the gitpod.yaml file.
Created a new user and generated AWS credentials for the user by:
- Navigating to the IAM USERS Console and enabling access for the user.
- Created an Admin group and gave it an AdministratorAccess or priviledge.
- Created the user and added the user to the Admin group.
- Clicked on Security Credentials and generated Access key.
- Then used the AWS CLI Access.
- Downloaded the CSV with the credentials.

Created both a Billing Alert and AWS Budget.
