# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing
## Insrumenting Honeycomb for Flask
- Started by first logging into my honeycomb account.
- Created Environment and copied API keys.

- Added API keys to Environment Variable in my Cloud Environment.
```
export HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=""
gp env HONEYCOMB_API_KEY=""
export HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME="Cruddur"
gp env HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME="Cruddur"
```
- Configured Open Telemetry(OTEL) service, endpoint and headers into backend-flask.
```
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT: "https://api.honeycomb.io"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS: "x-honeycomb-team=${HONEYCOMB_API_KEY}"
OTEL_SERVICE_NAME: "${HONEYCOMB_SERVICE_NAME}"
```

- Installed packages to instrument a Flask app with OpenTelemetry in the backend-flask. This is after adding the following files to my requirement.txt file:
```
opentelemetry-api 
opentelemetry-sdk 
opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-flask 
opentelemetry-instrumentation-requests
```
Then installed the files using:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

- Initialized the flask app with OpenTelemetry by copying and pasting the following codes in my `app.py` file:
```
from opentelemetry import trace
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.flask import FlaskInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.instrumentation.requests import RequestsInstrumentor
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace import TracerProvider
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import BatchSpanProcessor
```

```
# Initialize tracing and an exporter that can send data to Honeycomb
provider = TracerProvider()
processor = BatchSpanProcessor(OTLPSpanExporter())
provider.add_span_processor(processor)
trace.set_tracer_provider(provider)
tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
```

```
# Initialize automatic instrumentation with Flask
app = Flask(__name__)
FlaskInstrumentor().instrument_app(app)
RequestsInstrumentor().instrument()
```
